				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>The Palace is a fresh Ghanaian seafood restaurant. We source sustainable & line caught seafood, 
					as well as live crustaceans everyday. Ghanaian sea life is amongst the richest in the world. 
					The concept of our restaurant is to bring those wild species to the table, from your favourites 
					to those rare varieties you don't see everyday. 
					We head to the fish market every morning to hand pick the best for our daily changing set menus. 
					We love to eat, to take our time and enjoy the flavours in a series of small dishes. 
					Our degustation gives you the chance to do exactly that. More than a succession of plates, 
					we offer you an experience, a connection between each dish,
					 pulling from our seaside location in Takoradi. Complete the journey with our optional matching wines.</p>
